<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Publishes the project to GitHub in one command.

.DESCRIPTION
    Points the repository at your GitHub remote and pushes the entire history in
    a single operation. Git sends every commit in one transfer: there is no
    per-commit push, so eighty commits cost the same as one.

    Before running this, create an EMPTY repository at https://github.com/new
    (no README, no .gitignore, no licence). If GitHub adds any file for you, the
    push will be rejected as non-fast-forward.

.PARAMETER RemoteUrl
    The HTTPS or SSH URL of the empty GitHub repository.

.PARAMETER Branch
    Branch to publish. Defaults to main.

.PARAMETER Force
    Overwrite whatever is on the remote branch. Only use this if you know the
    remote history is disposable.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\publish.ps1 -RemoteUrl https://github.com/MatiasViillalba/word-c2.git
